INSERT INTO, UPDATE, DELETE FROM

"INSERT INTO"
The name of the table
So called 'fields' - the names of the fields that will be filled with the command, enclosed in brackets and separated by commas
So called 'values' – the values of the fields in the corresponding order as the 'fields', enclosed in brackets and separated by commas
Example:  "INSERT INTO users (user_id, login, gender, age) VALUES (1, yana, female, 20)"

"UPDATE"
The name of the table
"SET"
So called 'update field' – the name of the field and its new value, enclosed in brackets and separated by "="
"WHERE"
So called 'update condition' – a field name and a field value, enclosed in brackets and separated by "="
Example: " UPDATE users SET (login = root) WHERE (user_id = 1)"
Note: The command "UPDATE" can change only one field in the database table. It can have only one 'update condition' which will always be for equality. The field 'user_id' can not be updated. 

"DELETE FROM"
The name of the table
"WHERE"
So called 'delete condition' – a field name and a field value, enclosed in brackets and separated by "="
Example: "DELETE FROM users WHERE (user_id = 178)"
Note: The command "DELETE" can erase more than one entry (row) from the database table. It can only have one 'delete condition' which will always be for equality.


"INSERT INTO" errors:
The starting word 'INSERT' is missing
There is no 'login' field
The number of 'fields' and 'values' is different (if they are equal, they will always be arranged correctly: user_id, login, gender, age)
"UPDATE" errors:
The starting word "UPDATE" is missing
The 'update condition' refers to existing 'field'
The 'update field' is existing 'field'
The 'update condition' is a combination of existing 'field' – 'value'
"DELETE FROM" errors:
The starting word "DELETE" is missing
When you try to delete the field 'login'
The field from 'delete condition' does not exist
Note: Command "DELET FROM" – when the 'delete condition' is not valid, for example "DELETE FROM users WHERE (user_id = 1)" if we do not have 'field' 'user_id' with 'value' = '1', there is no error, just nothing happens. If on the same conditions the table is empty, nothing happens as well.
